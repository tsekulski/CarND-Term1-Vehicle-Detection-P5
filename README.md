# CarND-Vehicle-Detection-P5

_Technologies: OpenCV, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Support Vector Machines. Computer Vision, Machine Learning_

Detecting vehicles in the front camera video stream.

Created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM). Optimized and evaluated the model on video data from a automotive camera taken during highway driving.
